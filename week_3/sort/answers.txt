sort1 uses: Bubble Sort

How do you know?:

sort1 + sorted50000
time 0.005s

By far the lowest time a sorting algorithm took whilst sorting a big ordered set of numbers.
It took 'Big Omega (n)'.




sort2 uses: Merge Sort

sort2 + sorted50000
time 0.883s

How do you know?: It had a really low time ordering a random relatively small set of numbers compared to the sort3 program.



sort3 uses: Selection Sort

sort3 + sorted50000
time 0.395s

How do you know?: The other sorting algorithms have been detected.
Also, it took more time than the merge sort algorithm to order a relatively small random set of numbers.
