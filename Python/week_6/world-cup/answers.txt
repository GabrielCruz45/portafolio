Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: TODO
At 10 simulations the percentages were incorrect because there were not enough opportunities for each team to win a tournament.
At 10 times that, the percentages started stabilizing. Interestingly, this difference in simulations did not seem to take 'considerably' longer.
At 1000 the percentages seemed to stabilize, so the practical difference after this many simulations looks like is in time.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: TODO

If I'm getting charged for the second I would use the 100,000 simulations to get as many as I can for the fee.
At the same time, after about 1000 (in this case), I would consider the percentages good enough.
So it would depend if I'm in a 6 centisecond hurry.
